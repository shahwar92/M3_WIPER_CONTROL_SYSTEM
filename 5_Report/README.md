# Introduction
Car glass that is exposed to dirt or rainwater will usually be cleaned using a wiper. Usually, the wiper is attached to the front and rear sides. With the wiper, the driver’s view will not be hindered and so they can see clearly towards the front or rear. Wipers do have a very important role in the safety of the drivers because wiper performance is closely related to the safety of driving. If it rains a lot and the car doesn’t use wipers, the windshield will be dewy. Visible dew on the glass will block the view of the driver. When the driver’s view is hindered, the risk of an accident is very high. This makes the wipers a very important car enhancement and must be present on all types of vehicles.

## 4Ws and 1H

## Who

    The peeson/driver who drives any vehicle can use it to avoid accidents.

## What

    Wiper Control System is a safety system installed in all the vehicles to provide a clear vision to the driver by the wind screen. 

## When

    Whenever there is rain or dust particles setteled on the wind screen driver may use this system to clean the wind screen to get
    a clear view of the traffic.

## Where

    Where there is heavy or light rain falls or dust or dew in atmosphere.

## How

    This system can run by the enigine of the vehicle directly or simply it can get power from the battery installed in vehiles.
