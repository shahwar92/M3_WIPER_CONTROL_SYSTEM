# Introduction
Car glass that is exposed to dirt or rainwater will usually be cleaned using a wiper. Usually, the wiper is attached to the front and rear sides. With the wiper, the driver’s view will not be hindered and so they can see clearly towards the front or rear.
Wipers do have a very important role in the safety of the drivers because wiper performance is closely related to the safety of driving. If it rains a lot and the car doesn’t use wipers, the windshield will be dewy. Visible dew on the glass will block the view of the driver.
When the driver’s view is hindered, the risk of an accident is very high. This makes the wipers a very important car enhancement and must be present on all types of vehicles.
## History
By 1917, John Oeishi formed the Tri-Continental Corporation, later to become Trico, one of the largest manufacturers of windshield wipers in the world. The windshield wiper had reached mass production phase!
By the early 1920s, the hand-cranked wiper had been replaced by a system that uses engine vacuum to drive the mechanism. Vacuum wipers were great, except that their speed would vary according to engine load and speed. By the early '60s, vacuum wipers were replaced by an electric drive, and in the mid-'60s, the intermittent wiper was invented (and was initially rejected by Ford).
## Components
### 1. Wiper Motor
The wiper motor is one part of the wiper system that is useful for moving the wiper automatically. The commonly used wiper motor utilizes a magnet with a reduction gear. There are at least 2 types of wiper motors that can cause magnetic fields, namely the ferrite magnet type which uses permanent magnet ferrite, and the wound rotor type which uses a coil to produce an electromagnet.The wiper motor that is often used recently is the ferrite magnet type because this type of wiper has a relatively small size and has lightweight, so it is very suitable to be attached to any type of car.
### 2. Wiper Link
The wiper link is often referred to as the wiper lever which is useful for changing the rotation motion of the wiper motor into a movement that goes back and forth from the left and right. The front of the car usually uses a wiper system that uses two blades at once and the mechanism used to move the two blades using a parallel tandem system.
When the wiper starts to turn on, the wiper motor will rotate the crank arm and this will make the connecting rods pull and push each other. The wiper link will make the wiper arm work in a semicircle around the pivot shaft. The linking rod or connecting rod which is usually attached to the two wiper arms will make the two blades work simultaneously and work in parallel.
### 3. Wiper Arm
The wiper arm usually consists of a head that is used to tie the wiper arm to the wiper shaft. The springs will be useful for holding the blade. While the arm piece will be useful for the process of installing the blade and retainer to hold it completely.
The wiper blade usually consists of a rubber which is useful for cleaning the surface of the car glass. There is a combination of leaf spring packing with levers and clips to attach the blade to the wiper arm.
### 4. Wiper Blade
